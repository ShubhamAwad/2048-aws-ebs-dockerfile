# 2048-aws-ebs-dockerfile
A Dockerfile made using a repository of game 2048 and deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

About--
  2048 is a popular puzzle game where the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the tile with the value of 2048. Players move tiles on a grid by swiping in four directions (up, down, left, or right), causing all tiles to shift in that direction until they reach the edge of the grid or collide with another tile. When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a single tile with double the value. The game ends when the grid is completely filled, and no more moves can be made. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score by strategically merging tiles and creating larger numbers.
